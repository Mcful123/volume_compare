# volume_compare
The compV3.h5 is used to determine of which two sample photo has the higher volume. It can correctly identify the higher volume about 87% of the time. The sorted.txt has a list of the 100 images in the sorted folder in order from smallest to largest. The 'find_position()' function identifies where in the sorted list a new image should be inserted. This index in the list (divided by 10) is returned to the user as the sample volume. i.e: The function will return a value from 0.0 to 10.0 depending on where in the length 100 list the image should be inserted (but it is not actually inserted). This is done with the 'compare()' function that incorporates the compV3.h5 model. <br /> 

The algorithm for finding the index is a binary search and it has OK reliability of finding the volume. Accuracy may be increased if another algorithm is used to find the position using the compare() function.
